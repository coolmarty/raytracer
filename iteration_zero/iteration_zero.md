This program reads an input file described in the first paramater that MUST contain three strings: imsize, followed by height in pixels, followed by width in pixels.

This program will then output a correct P3 .ppm header describing the image dimensions and maximum color value of 255. 

After this, the program does a quick computation to describe a pixel hue in a gradient between two hard-coded rgb values, defaulting to lavender and teal. The two colors can be easily modified, although not from the command line.
